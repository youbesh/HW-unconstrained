# in case you didn't open julia from this directory, we need to move you here first:
home = ENV["HOME"]
cd("$home/Dropbox/teaching/ScPo/ScPo-CompEcon/HW-unconstrained")	# you need to change this path.


# include your code and test it:
# execute both lines if you changed your code
include("src/HW_unconstrained.jl")
include("test/runtests.jl")


# use your code in the console
# after doing include("src/maxlike.jl"),
# your module is visible, along with all objects that you decided to export. e.g. you could do
using HW_unconstrained
data = makeData()	
# to manually examine this function
